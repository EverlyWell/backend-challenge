# EverlyWell Backend Challenge

## Application stack

- PostgreSQL v12+
- Ruby 2.7.2
- Ruby on Rails 6.1

## Environmental variables

```bash
# Database URL. REQUIRED.
DATABASE_URL=
# JWT HMAC secret
JWT_HMAC_SECRET=
# Rails master key for decrypting credentials file
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=
# REDIS URL. REQUIRED.
REDIS_URL=
```

## Development environment

### Dependencies

- Bundler 2.1+
- Docker
- Graphviz
- RVM

### Setup

```bash
# Afer installing RVM, create and use gemset
rvm use --create --install

# For rails-erd gem
brew install graphviz

# Setup a PostgreSQL instance with Docker
docker run --name pg12 -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=123456 -e POSTGRES_USER=gu -d postgres:12-alpine

# Spin up a Redis 5 Docker container
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:5-alpine

# Gem installation (make sure it's v2.1+)
gem install bundler
bundle

# Base templates with necessary env vars
cp .env.development .env.development.local
cp .env.test .env.test.local

#Setup the databases
bin/rails db:create RAILS_ENV=test
bin/rails db:setup

# Run the web server with:
bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb

# Run Sidekiq workers
bundle exec sidekiq -t 25
```

### Considerations when running migrations in development mode

Running `rails db:migrate` will update the `erd.png` diagram and annotate the models, factories and specs.

## Documentation

### API Docs

To generate the API documentation run `rake docs:generate`. The documentation can be found in [docs/api/index.html](docs/api/index.html). To browse the documentation, type `open docs/api/index.html` after generating it.

API docs are created with the help of the [rspec_api_documentation](https://github.com/zipmark/rspec_api_documentation) gem.

## Important notes

* Development/test secrets are stored on `.env.test` and `.env.development` files, since these are local, development credentials, no harm on them being in version control.

### Overview

Using Ruby on Rails, we'd like you to create a simple experts directory search tool. The tool can either be a full featured application or API only.

* Spend no more than 4 hours coding for the project. Do not include any initial application setup in this time limit.

### Requirements:

The application should fulfill the following requirements:

* A member can be created using their name and a personal website address.
* When a member is created, all the heading (h1-h3) values are pulled in from the website to that members profile.
* The website url is shortened (e.g. using http://goo.gl).
* After the member has been added, I can define their friendships with other existing members. Friendships are bi-directional i.e. If David is a friend of Oliver, Oliver is always a friend of David as well.
* The interface should list all members with their name, short url and the number of friends.
* Viewing an actual member should display the name, website URL, shortening, website headings, and links to their friends' pages.
* Now, looking at Alan's profile, I want to find experts in the application who write about a certain topic and are not already friends of Alan.
* Results should show the path of introduction from Alan to the expert e.g. Alan wants to get introduced to someone who writes about 'Dog breeding'. Claudia's website has a heading tag "Dog breeding in Ukraine". Bart knows Alan and Claudia. An example search result would be Alan -> Bart -> Claudia ("Dog breeding in Ukraine").

We encourage the use of any libraries for everything except the search functionality, in which we want to see your simple algorithm approach.

### Add-ons:

* Sign up/log in functionality
* A UI that expands upon the basic requirements to have a user-friendly look and feel
* Anything else you, as a user, would enjoy seeing in an interface like this

### Things we're looking for:

* Navigable code
* Efficient algorithms
* Good separation of concerns
* Error handling
* Usage of gems/libraries

### Things we like:

* Well commented & well organized code
* Quality over quantity (the code you write should be good)
* Small, meaningful, commits
* Tests!
* Respect for the time limit - if you are in the midst of some work that you would like to finish, but have hit the 4 hour time limit, please split additional work into a separate branch, to be evaluated separately

### Submission

* __Fork__ this repository to your own git
* Remember to make meaningful commits as you work
* Somehow share your repository with us
* __Important:__ If there are credentials required (.env or master.key file), please email these to us directly or we canâ€™t review your project
