# EverlyWell Challenge

### Overview

Using a language and framework of your choice, we'd like you to create a simple experts directory search tool. The tool can either be a full featured application or API only.

* Spend, at max, 4 hours on this project.

### Requirements

The application should fulfill the following requirements:

* A member can be created using their name and a personal website address.

* When a member is created, all the heading (h1-h3) values are pulled in from the website to that members profile.

* The website url is shortened (e.g. using http://goo.gl).

* After the member has been added, I can define their friendships with other existing members. Friendships are bi-directional i.e. If David is a friend of Oliver, Oliver is always a friend of David as well.

* The interface should list all members with their name, short url and the number of friends.

* Viewing an actual member should display the name, website URL, shortening, website headings, and links to their friends' pages.

* Now, looking at Alan's profile, I want to find experts in the application who write about a certain topic and are not already friends of Alan.

* Results should show the path of introduction from Alan to the expert e.g. Alan wants to get introduced to someone who writes about 'Dog breeding'. Claudia's website has a heading tag "Dog breeding in Ukraine". Bart knows Alan and Claudia. An example search result would be Alan -> Bart -> Claudia ("Dog breeding in Ukraine").

We encourage the use of any libraries for everything except the search functionality, in which we want to see your simple algorithm approach.

### Submission

Once you've completed the technical requirements, submit the code to us somehow! Be original!
